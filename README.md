*Work in progress*

Rick and morty api project with login / logout ( from my initial project - https://github.com/Rihkar/riks-un-mortiks ).

There are three 'admin accounts' , each has access to a specific route.

You can sign up, and then log in, to be shown a random rick and morty character.

Sign up has basic validation and password is hidden with the option to be checked.

Next step:

When signing up and logging, the account allways gets the same unique character.

All the signed up accounts are registered in a server.
